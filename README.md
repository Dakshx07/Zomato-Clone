Search Functionality: Users can search for restaurants, cuisines, and more with a location-based search bar that supports detecting the user's current location or selecting a predefined city.
Location Detection: Users can either manually select a city or automatically detect their location using the browserâ€™s geolocation feature.
Responsive Design: The website adapts to various screen sizes, offering an optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Interactive Features: Hover effects on boxes, smooth background fade-in animations, and dropdown menus make the user experience more engaging.
Content Sections:
Order Online: Links to online food delivery options.
Dining: Discover the best dining venues in the city.
Live Events: Explore upcoming events and concerts.
